/**
 * `archived`, `pinned` and `muted` on the whatsapp-web.js side of `ChatSummary`.
 *
 * Both places that build a summary have to carry the three, and they are built independently:
 * `getChats` maps the library's `Chat` model, while `getChatsByLabel` maps the entries
 * `getChatsByLabelId` returns. A field added to one and forgotten in the other is invisible until
 * a Business account lists a label, so both mappers are held to the same shape here.
 *
 * The library reports mute as a verdict already — `Chat.isMuted` — so unlike Baileys there is no
 * end-time comparison to make; `muteExpiration` is the raw stamp behind it and is deliberately not
 * what this maps. Each field is read through `Boolean()` because the page can leave any of them
 * undefined on a chat it built from a partial record, and `undefined` must land as `false` rather
 * than escape into a required boolean.
